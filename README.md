🏦 Loan Approval Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project is my first end-to-end Machine Learning application, built as part of my journey into ML.
The goal is to predict whether a loan should be Approved or Rejected based on applicant details.

Through this project, I explored the complete ML workflow — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and deploying a simple web app using Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview

Problem: Predict loan approval status based on applicant financial and personal data

Type: Binary classification (Approved / Rejected)

What I focused on learning:

Cleaning and preparing real-world data using Pandas

Feature engineering (Net Worth)

Training and evaluating a classification model

Handling class imbalance

Building a basic interactive ML app using Streamlit

📊 Dataset Description

Key features used for prediction:

no_of_dependents

education (Graduate / Not Graduate)

self_employed (Yes / No)

income_annum

loan_amount

loan_term

cibil_score

net_worth (engineered feature)

Target variable:

loan_status

1 → Approved

0 → Rejected

🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Some of the steps I worked on:

Removing unnecessary columns

Standardizing column names

Cleaning string values

Encoding categorical variables

Creating a new feature:

net_worth = residential + commercial + luxury + bank assets


All data cleaning and preprocessing steps are documented in the notebook.

🤖 Model Details

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Scaling: StandardScaler

Class imbalance handling: class_weight="balanced"

Train–Test Split: 80% / 20%

📈 Model Performance

Accuracy: ~91.8%

Low number of false approvals

Good recall for rejected loans (important for loan approval problems)

🖥️ Streamlit Web App

I built a simple Streamlit app to:

Take user inputs through sliders and dropdowns

Predict loan approval status in real time

Display clear and user-friendly results

▶️ Run the app locally
streamlit run src/app.py


The app opens at:

http://localhost:8501

📦 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan-approval-ML.git
cd Loan-approval-ML

2️⃣ Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚠️ Git & Data Handling

Cleaned datasets are not pushed to GitHub

They are generated by running the notebook

.gitignore keeps the repository clean and reproducible

🚀 Future Improvements

Since I’m still learning ML, there’s a lot I’d like to explore next:

Trying other models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Threshold tuning based on business risk

Adding probability visualization in the app

Deploying the app on Streamlit Cloud

Learning model explainability (SHAP)

🧠 What I Learned From This Project

How an end-to-end ML pipeline works

Importance of data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling imbalanced datasets

Evaluating models beyond just accuracy

Deploying ML models using Streamlit

Maintaining a clean GitHub project structure
